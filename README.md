## Hello team Shopify :wave:

__There was a lot I wish I could've done with this project but unfortunately I ran out of time. I achieved some of the requirements for the assessment and given an opportunity I would love to ask a few questions and discuss about some of the feature ideas suggested. It was really exciting working on this assessment, I definitely felt pushed to learn a lot.__ :smile::coffee::technologist:
